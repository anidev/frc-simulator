This contains libraries that can be used by a simulator interface for communicating with the running simulator located either locally or remotely. The purpose of having a network-based command and control input/output is to provide flexibility both in which computer and which software can interact with the simulator, as well as allow any network-capable programming language to communicate with any of the three FRC robotics simulators (cpp, java, or lv).

Currently two full-featured apis and implementations are planned for netcontrol: one for C/C++, which will be used by the other frc-cpp-sim simulator libraries for communicating with the connected interface and by the C++ CLI interface, and one for Java, which will be used by the Java GUI interface for interacting with the locally or remotely running simulator.
