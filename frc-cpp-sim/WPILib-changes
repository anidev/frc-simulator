Removed OSAL/Task.cpp and OSAL/Task.h
OSAL/Synchronized.cpp:
	Removed SEM_ID constructor
	Removed references to usingSem
	Initialized m_semaphore reference in constructor
	Changed m_sem to m_semaphore and -> to .
	Removed unnecessary SEM_ID code form destructor
Uses https://github.com/anidev/networktables-pc instead of built in networktables
Comment out sin_len where it is ued
	sed -ri 's/(.*sin_len.*)/\/\/\1/g' `find -type f`
Vision/PCVideoServer.cpp:
	Changed type of clientAddrSize from int to socklen_t
ErrorBase.cpp:
	Does not include vxworks symbol table headers if simulating
		symLib.h, sysSymTbl.h
	ErrorBase::SetErrnoError:
		Does not attempt to look up symbols if simulating
Utility.cpp:
	Does not include vxworks debugging headers if simulating
		dbgLib.h, sysSymTbl.h
	Prints debugging info via GNU's execinfo.h if simulating
Includes semLib.h in NetworkCommunication/FRCComm.h
RobotBase.cpp:
	Does not include vxworks module headers if simulating
		moduleLib.h, unldLib.h
	Does not check if FRC_RobotTask exists if simulating
Change all Task::Start calls so they use taskarg_t instead of int32_t
	sed -ri 's/Start\(\((u?)int(32_t)?/Start\(\(taskarg_t/g' `find -type f`
	Also they should include taskLib.h
	Also arguments should be taskarg_t (only relevant for RobotBase.cpp)
