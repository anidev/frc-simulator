This folder contains an implementation of functions in the NetworkCommunication/FRCComm.h header in WPILib. WPILib will use these functions for communicating with the driver station. This library will take care of repackaging and resending the data received from WPILib to the connected simulator interface using the protocol and apis in the library netcontrol, located above this subdirectory.

This folder will also contain implementations of other selected function in the NetworkCommunication folder of WPILib, such as the nUsageReporting::report method and the FRC_NetworkCommunication_* functions.
